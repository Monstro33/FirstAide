# STEP 1: GIVE 30 CHEST COMPRESSIONS

-  Place the infant on a firm, flat surface. 

- Push hard, push fast in the middle of the chest.

- Push about 1½ inches
deep.

- Push fast, at least 100
compressions per minute.

# STEP 2: GIVE 2 RESCUE BREATHS

- Tilt the head back and lift the chin up.

- Make a complete seal
  over infant’s mouth and nose.

- Blow in for about 1 second to
  make the chest clearly rise.

- Give rescue breaths, one after
  the other.

# STEP 3: DO NOT STOP

- Continue cycles of CPR. Do not stop CPR unless:
    -   You find an obvious sign of life,
    such as breathing.
    -   An AED is ready to use.
    - You are too exhausted to continue.
    - The scene becomes unsafe.

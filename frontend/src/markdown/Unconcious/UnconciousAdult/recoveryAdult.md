-  Press firmly but not so hard that you can no longer feel the pulse. 

-  Put your index and third finger on either side of the neck to the side of your windpipe to find the carotid artery.

- If you’re measuring on the wrist, set two fingers between the bone and tendon over your radial artery.

- Find your radial artery by drawing a line with your finger from below your thumb to your wrist. Then feel for the spot between the wrist bone and tendon for a slight pumping motion.

- Place the flat part of your finger on your wrist or neck to get the most accurate reading. Avoid using your fingertips or your thumb

- Place the arm nearest to you at a right angle to his body, so the elbow is towards you. The palm should be facing up and in front of the head.

- Then take the other arm and place it across his chest. Tuck the hand under the side of his head, so the back of the hand is against the cheek.

- After positioning the arms, you should bend the knee of the leg farthest away from you, so the foot is flat on the floor.

- Take hold of the raised knee, and carefully pull it towards you and down.

- Ensure that the hand you placed under the head stays there and supports the head. Be slow and careful to ensure you do not bang the head against the ground.

- The arm you extended out a right angle will stop her from rolling over any further. Rolling too far can block free expansion of the chest and impede breathing.

- You can also roll the person by grabbing her firmly by the hip — either by a belt or the waistband of her pants, or by a front pocket — and pulling, with one hand on the shoulder farthest from you for stabilization.

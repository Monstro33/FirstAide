# STEP 1: CHECK FOR RESPONSIVENESS

- Tap the shoulder and shout, “Are you OK?.

# STEP 2: CALL 9-1-1

- If an unconscious child is face-down,      roll face-up, supporting the head, neck,   and back in a straight line.

- IF ALONE, give about 2 minutes of CARE,    then CALL 9-1-1.

- If the child or infant responds, CALL      9-1-1. CHECK the child from head to toe    and ask questions to find out what         happened.

# STEP 3: OPEN THE AIRWAY

- Tilt head back slightly, lift chin.

# STEP 4: CHECK FOR BREATHING

- CHECK quickly for no more than 10          seconds.
- Occasional gasps are not breathing.

# STEP 5: GIVE 2 RESCUE BREATHS

- If no breathing, tilt the head back and    lift the chin up.
- Pinch the nose shut, then make a
  complete seal over child’s mouth.
- Blow in for about 1 second to make the
  chest clearly rise.
- If the chest does not rise with rescue     breaths, retilt the head and give          another rescue breath.
- Give another rescue breath, ensuring you   give 2 complete unobstructed breaths. 
- If the child or infant responds, CALL      9-1-1. CHECK the child from head to toe    and ask questions to find out what         happened.

- Press firmly but not so hard that you can no longer feel the pulse.
- Put your index and third finger on either side of the neck to the side of the windpipe to find the carotid artery.
- If you’re measuring on the wrist, set two fingers between the bone and tendon over the radial artery.
- Find the radial artery by drawing a line with your finger from below the thumb to the wrist. Then feel for the spot between the wrist bone and tendon for a slight pumping motion.
- Place the flat part of your finger on the wrist or neck to get the most accurate reading. Avoid using your fingertips or your thumb.
- If the child loses consciousness and does not have a pulse, GO TO

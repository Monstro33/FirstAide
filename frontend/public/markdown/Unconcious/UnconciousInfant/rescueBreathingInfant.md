<h2>ASSESS THE SITUATION</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/AdultShock/adultShock9.jpg)

- Rescue breathing is used for people who are unconscious and breathing and have a pulse.

<h2>CHECK RESPONSIVENESS</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/InfantCPR/infantCPR15.jpg)

- If the infant is on their side or stomach, then gently roll him onto his back while trying to support their head and neck.

- Talk to the infant to ellict a response.

- Flick the bottom of their foot.

- Also tap their shoulder or arm while you do it to see if that will help as well.

- If this doesn't work, try yelling once or twice at them to see if that will rouse them.

<h2>OPEN THE AIRWAY</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/InfantCPR/infantCPR6.jpg)

- Place one hand behind their head and one hand under his chin. Tilt the head slightly backward toward the sky.

- The chin should end in a slightly lifted position, as if they are sniffing the air.

<h2>CHECK FOR BREATHING</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/InfantCPR/infantCPR12.jpg)

- Take 5 to 10 seconds to look for the rise and fall of the chest.

-Gasping is not considered to be normal breathing.

- If there is not a rise of the chest, try to re-position the airway a little in either direction.

- Also look for nose fluctuations.

- Place your hand near her nose and mouth to see if you feel any breath.

- If you don't, lean your head down close to the infant’s mouth and feel for breath on your cheek and listen for any inhales or exhales.

- If the infant is not breathing or not breathing adequately, GO TO

<h2>CHECK FOR PULSE</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/InfantCPR/infantCPR3.jpg)

- Press firmly but not so hard that you can no longer feel the pulse.

- Put your point and middle finger on the infant’s inner bend of the upper arm at the back of the elbow.

- Count the pulse rate of the infant for one full minute.

- Infants generally have higher pulse rates than adults.

- They’re heart rates generally fall between 140 and 160 beats per minute, even at rest.

- If the infant does not have a pulse, GO TO

<h2>POSITION THE HEAD</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/ChildRescueBreathing/childRescueBreathing3.jpg)

- The head should be straight and not tilted to either side.

- Put one hand under the child’s chin and the other on the top of the head. Gently tilt the head back and lift the chin.

- Use your thumb and forefinger to close the child’s nose. If the child is younger than one year, you don’t need to do this because you will breathe into both the child’s nose and mouth.

- Do not move the head more than necessary if you think the child may have a spinal cord injury.

<h2>PROVIDE RESCUE BREATHS</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/ChildRescueBreathing/childRescueBreathing4.jpg)

- Take a breath and lean over the infant and cover both the nose and the mouth with your mouth.

- Breathe gently and steadily into the infants’s mouth for one to one and a half seconds, watching for the chest to rise.

- After exhaling into the infant’s mouth turn your head and watch to see if the chest deflates as it would during natural breathing.

- If so, this suggests that the breath was effective and the airway is not blocked.

<h2>CLEAR THE AIRWAY IF NECESSARY</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/ChildRescueBreathing/childRescueBreathing4.jpg)

- If the airway is obstructed, you may see that the breath you exhale doesn’t inflate the lungs.

- Open the child’s mouth. Look inside to see if you see any pieces of food or objects that the child may have choked on. If so, remove them.

- Do not poke your fingers or any other object deep into the child’s throat. If you do, you run the risk of pushing an object further in.

- If you don't see an object, reposition the child's head and try another rescue breath.

<h2>CALL 9-1-1</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/InfantCPR/infantCPR16.jpg)

- After performing 2 minutes of rescue breathing, call Emergency Services if you are the only person available.
- If two or more people are available, one person should dial for help while the other continues with rescue breathing.

<h2>CONTINUE RESCUE BREATHING</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/ChildRescueBreathing/childRescueBreathing6.jpg)

- Continue rescue breathing, giving one breath every 6 seconds (10 breaths per minute).
- Check for a pulse every two minutes while doing rescue breathing.
- Continue with rescue breathing until the child begins breathing on their own.
- You will notice that they are improving if they start coughing or moving.
- If the infant loses consciousness and is not breathing or not breathing adequately, GO TO

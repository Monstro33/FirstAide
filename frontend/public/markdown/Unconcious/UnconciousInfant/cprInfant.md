- Put your point and middle finger on the infant’s inner bend of the upper arm at the back of the elbow.

- Press your fingers firmly but gently against the baby’s skin to try to feel the pulse.

- Place the flat part of your finger to get the most accurate reading. Avoid using your fingertips or your thumb.

# STEP 2: DETERMINE IF CPR IS NECESASARY

# STEP 4: GIVE 30 CHEST COMPRESSIONS

- Place the infant on a firm, flat surface.

- Place two or three fingers near the middle of the chest below the nipple line.

- Push hard, push fast in the middle of the chest.

- Push straight down about 1-1½ inches
  deep.

- The smaller body of a child needs less pressure.

- Push at a rate of 100 compressions per minute.

- If you begin to hear or feel a cracking sound, you are pushing too hard. Continue, but apply less pressure with the compressions.

- Allow complete chest recoil after each compression.

- limit interruptions to less than 10 seconds.

- If there are two rescuers, each should complete a round of 15 compressions.

# STEP 2: GIVE 2 RESCUE BREATHS

- Tilt the head back and lift the chin up.

- Make a complete seal
  over infant’s mouth and nose.

- Blow in for about 1 second to
  make the chest clearly rise.

  - Avoid blowing forcefully, since a baby's lungs are smaller, they only need regular breaths. Blowing forcefully could damage the baby's lungs.

  - Be sure to lift the chin up

- Give rescue breaths, one after
  the other.

# STEP 3: DO NOT STOP

- Continue cycles of CPR. Do not stop CPR unless:
  - You find an obvious sign of life,
    such as breathing.
  - An AED is ready to use.
  - You are too exhausted to continue.
  - The scene becomes unsafe.

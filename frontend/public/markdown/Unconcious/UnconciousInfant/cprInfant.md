# STEP 1: CHECK RESPONSIVENESS

![Alt text](/Images/InfantCPR/infantCPR15.jpg)

- If the infant is on their side or stomach, then gently roll him onto his back while trying to support their head and neck.

- Talk to the infant to ellict a response.

- Flick the bottom of their foot.

- Also tap their shoulder or arm while you do it to see if that will help as well.

- If this doesn't work, try yelling once or twice at them to see if that will rouse them.

# STEP 2: VERIFY THEY ARE UNRESPONSIVE

![Alt text](/Images/AdultCPR/adultCPR23.jpg)

- Perform a light to moderate sternal rub to establish that the infant is indeed unresponsive.

- You don't want to do CPR on someone who is just poorly responsive but breathing and circulating blood.

- Make a fist and rub your knuckles hard on the infants’s breastbone.

- You can also grasp the muscles of the shoulder with your thumb and fingers and light to moderately squeeze into the hollow of the collarbone.

- Bend low as you do this and listen for sounds or signs of breathing.

# STEP 3: OPEN THE AIRWAY

- Place one hand behind their head and one hand under his chin. Tilt the head slightly backward toward the sky.

- The chin should end in a slightly lifted position, as if they are sniffing the air.

# STEP 4: REMOVE FOREIGN OBJECTS FROM THE AIRWAY

- If the airway is visibally obstructed by vomit or any removable matter, get it out of the mouth with a quick swipes with two or three fingers in her mouth.

- You can quickly turn the victim’s head to one side to assist in the removal.

- Use sweeping motions rather than digging ones.

# STEP 5: CHECK FOR BREATHING

![Alt text](/Images/InfantCPR/infantCPR12.jpg)

- Take 5 to 10 seconds to look for the rise and fall of the chest.

-Gasping is not considered to be normal breathing.

- If there is not a rise of the chest, try to re-position the airway a little in either direction.

- Also look for nose fluctuations.

- Place your hand near her nose and mouth to see if you feel any breath.

- If you don't, lean your head down close to the infant’s mouth and feel for breath on your cheek and listen for any inhales or exhales.

# STEP 6: CHECK FOR PULSE

![Alt text](/Images/InfantCPR/infantCPR3.jpg)

- Press firmly but not so hard that you can no longer feel the pulse.

- Put your point and middle finger on the infant’s inner bend of the upper arm at the back of the elbow.

- Count the pulse rate of the infant for one full minute.

- Infants generally have higher pulse rates than adults.

- They’re heart rates generally fall between 140 and 160 beats per minute, even at rest

# STEP 7: DETERMINE IF CPR IS NECESASARY

- IF NO PULSE, CONTINUE WITH STEPS.

-IF PULSE IS PRESENT, CLICK HERE FOR - RESCUE BREATHING -

# STEP 8: POSITION YOUR FINGERS IN THE CENTER OF THE CHEST

![Alt text](/Images/InfantCPR/infantCPR22.jpg)

- Place the infant on a firm, flat surface, with the head facing up.

- Position the tips of two or three fingers in the center of the baby's chest.

- The fingers should be placed in between the baby's nipples at the center of his chest.

# STEP 9: GIVE 30 CHEST COMPRESSIONS

![Alt text](/Images/InfantCPR/infantCPR23.jpg)

- Gently push straight down on the chest, depressing it by about 1.5 inches (4 cm).

- Perform 30 compressions rapidly at a rate of 100 compressions per minute.

* Each compression should be smooth, not abrupt or shaky.

-Be careful not to injure the baby's ribs during the compressions

- If you're not sure what 100 compressions a minute really means, try doing your compressions to the beat of the Bee Gee's song "Stain' Alive."

- limit interruptions to less than 10 seconds.

- Allow complete chest recoil after each compression.

- If there are two rescuers, each should complete a round of 15 compressions.

# STEP 10: PROCEED TO OPEN THE AIRWAY

![Alt text](/Images/InfantCPR/infantCPR11.jpg)

- Put your palm on their forehead and gently tilt (extend) their head back a little.

- Then with your other hand, gently lift the chin forward to open up their airway.

- If you suspect a neck/head/spine injury, sit above the infant's head. Place one hand on each side of the infant's jaw and lift the jaw so that it is jutting forward,as though the infant has an underbite.

# STEP 11: GIVE 2 RESCUE BREATHS

![Alt text](/Images/InfantCPR/infantCPR20.jpg)

- Make sure their mouth is free of any objects blocking their airway.

- Use one hand to pinch the nose shut then make a complete seal over the child’s mouth.

- Blow in for about 1 second to make the chest clearly rise.

- Give rescue breaths, one after the other.

- If chest does not rise with rescue breaths, retilt the head and give another rescue breath.

# STEP 12: CALL 9-1-1

![Alt text](/Images/InfantCPR/infantCPR16.jpg)

- After performing five cycles of chest compressions and rescue breathing or CPR for at least 2 minutes of CPR, call Emergency Services if you are the only person available.

- If two or more people are available, one person should dial for help while the other continues with CPR.

# STEP 13: DO NOT STOP

![Alt text](/Images/InfantCPR/infantCPR21.jpg)

- Continue cycles of CPR. Do not stop CPR unless:

  - You find an obvious sign of life,
    such as breathing.

  - You are too exhausted to continue.

  - The scene becomes unsafe.

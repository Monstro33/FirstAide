## CHECK FOR PULSE

![Alt text](/Images/AdultShock/adultShock7.jpg)

- Press firmly but not so hard that you can no longer feel the pulse.

- Put your index and third finger on either side of the neck to the side of your windpipe to find the carotid artery.

- If you’re measuring on the wrist, set two fingers between the bone and tendon over your radial artery.

- Find your radial artery by drawing a line with your finger from below your thumb to your wrist. Then feel for the spot between the wrist bone and tendon for a slight pumping motion.

- Place the flat part of your finger on your wrist or neck to get the most accurate reading. Avoid using your fingertips or your thumb

- Push hard, push fast in the middle of the chest at least 1-2 inches deep.

- Push at a rate of 100 compressions per minute.

- If you begin to hear or feel a cracking sound, you are pushing too hard. Continue, but apply less pressure with the compressions.

- Allow complete chest recoil after each compression.

- limit interruptions to less than 10 seconds.

- If there are two rescuers, each should complete a round of 15 compressions.

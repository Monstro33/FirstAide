# STEP 1: ASSESS THE SITUATION

- The recovery position is used for people who are unconscious but breathing.

- This position is not intented for people with spinal injuries.

# STEP 2: CHECK FOR BREATHING AND CONSCIOUSNESS

- Check to see if the person is unconscious, but breathing, and has no other life-threatening conditions.

- Talk to the person to assess if they are responsive.

Check for breathing by placing your cheek near the nose and mouth of the person to feel their breath.

If the person is breathing and unconscious or semi-conscious, you can place them in the recovery position.
 
# STEP 3: CHECK FOR PULSE

- Press firmly but not so hard that you can no longer feel the pulse.

- Put your index and third finger on either side of the neck to the side of the windpipe to find the carotid artery.

- If you’re measuring on the wrist, set two fingers between the bone and tendon over your radial artery.

- Find the radial artery by drawing a line with your finger from below the thumb to the wrist. Then feel for the spot between the wrist bone and tendon for a slight pumping motion.

- Place the flat part of your finger on the wrist or neck to get the most accurate reading. Avoid using your fingertips or your thumb.

# STEP 4: POSITION THE ARMS AND LEGS

- Once you have established that it is safe to put them into the recovery position, kneel down to one side of them so you can position the arms.

- Place the arm nearest to you at a right angle to their body, so the elbow is towards you. The palm should be facing up and in front of the head.

- Then take the other arm and place it across their chest. Tuck the hand under the side of his head, so the back of the hand is against the cheek.

- After positioning the arms, you should bend the knee of the leg farthest away from you, so the foot is flat on the floor.

# STEP 8: ROLL THEM TOWARDS YOU

- Take hold of the raised knee, and carefully pull it towards you and down.

- Ensure that the hand you placed under the head stays there and supports the head. Be slow and careful to ensure you do not bang the head against the ground.

- The arm you extended out a right angle will stop her from rolling over any further. Rolling too far can block free expansion of the chest and impede breathing.

- You can also roll the person by grabbing her firmly by the hip — either by a belt or the waistband of their pants, or by a front pocket — and pulling, with one hand on the shoulder farthest from you for stabilization.

# STEP 9: OPEN THE AIRWAY

- Gently tilt the head back and lift the chin. Check that the airway is clear of any blockages.

- Continue to monitor the pulse and breathing while you wait for help to arrive.

- Cover them with a blanket or coat to keep them warm.

# STEP 10: MONITOR AND KEEP WARM

## ASSESS THE SITUATION

![Alt text](/Images/AdultShock/adultShock9.jpg)

- Rescue breathing is used for people who are unconscious and breathing and have a pulse.

## CHECK FOR BREATHING AND CONSCIOUSNESS

![Alt text](/Images/AdultShock/adultShock2.jpg)

- Check to see if the person is unconscious, but breathing, and has no other life-threatening conditions.
- Talk to the person to assess if they are responsive.
  Check for breathing by placing your cheek near the nose and mouth of the person to feel their breath for 5 to 10 seconds.
  If the person is breathing and unconscious or semi-conscious, you can place them in the recovery position.

## CHECK FOR PULSE

- Press firmly but not so hard that you can no longer feel the pulse.
- Put your index and third finger on either side of the neck to the side of the windpipe to find the carotid artery.
- If you’re measuring on the wrist, set two fingers between the bone and tendon over your radial artery.
- Find the radial artery by drawing a line with your finger from below the thumb to the wrist. Then feel for the spot between the wrist bone and tendon for a slight pumping motion.
- Place the flat part of your finger on the wrist or neck to get the most accurate reading. Avoid using your fingertips or your thumb.

## CALL 9-1-1

- After performing CPR for a full cycle or at least a minute, pause CPR and call 9-1-1 as quick as possible.
- If two or more people are available, one person should dial for help while the other continues with CPR.

## PROCEED TO OPEN THE AIRWAY

- Put your palm on their forehead and gently tilt (extend) their head back a little.
- Then with your other hand, gently lift the chin forward to open up their airway.
- If you suspect a neck/head/spine injury, sit above the person's head. Place one hand on each side of the person's jaw and lift the jaw so that it is jutting forward,as though the person has an underbite.

## GIVE RESCUE BREATHS

- Make sure their mouth is free of any objects blocking their airway.
- Use one hand to pinch the nose shut then make a complete seal over the person’s mouth.
- Blow in for about 1 second to make the
  chest clearly rise.

- Give 2 rescue breaths, one after the other.
- If chest does not rise with rescue breaths, retilt the head and give another rescue breath.
- Remove your mouth and take a normal breath between rescue breath attempts.
- After exhaling into the person’s mouth turn your head and watch to see if the chest deflates as it would during natural breathing.
- If so, this suggests that the breath was effective and the airway is not blocked.

## CLEAR THE AIRWAY IF NECESSARY

- If the airway is obstructed, you may see that the breath you exhale doesn’t inflate the lungs.
- Open the child’s mouth. Look inside to see if you see any pieces of food or objects that the child may have choked on. If so, remove them.
- Do not poke your fingers or any other object deep into the child’s throat. If you do, you run the risk of pushing an object further in.
- If you don't see an object, reposition the child's head and try another rescue breath.

## CONTINUE WITH RESCUE BREATHS

![Alt text](/Images/AdultCPR/adultCPR29.jpg)

- Continue rescue breathing, giving one breath every 6 seconds (10 breaths per minute).
- Check for a pulse every two minutes while doing rescue breathing.
- Continue with rescue breathing until the person begins breathing on their own.
- You will notice that they are improving if they start coughing or moving.

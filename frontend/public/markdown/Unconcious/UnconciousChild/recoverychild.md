## POSITION THE ARMS AND LEGS

- Once you have established that it is safe to put them into the recovery position, kneel down to one side of them so you can position the arms.
- Place the arm nearest to you at a right angle to their body, so the elbow is towards you. The palm should be facing up and in front of the head.
- Then take the other arm and place it across their chest. Tuck the hand under the side of his head, so the back of the hand is against the cheek.
- After positioning the arms, you should bend the knee of the leg farthest away from you, so the foot is flat on the floor.

## ROLL THEM TOWARDS YOU

- Take hold of the raised knee, and carefully pull it towards you and down.
- Ensure that the hand you placed under the head stays there and supports the head. Be slow and careful to ensure you do not bang the head against the ground.
- The arm you extended out a right angle will stop her from rolling over any further. Rolling too far can block free expansion of the chest and impede breathing.
- You can also roll the person by grabbing her firmly by the hip — either by a belt or the waistband of their pants, or by a front pocket — and pulling, with one hand on the shoulder farthest from you for stabilization.

## OPEN THE AIRWAY

- Gently tilt the head back and lift the chin. Check that the airway is clear of any blockages.
- Continue to monitor the pulse and breathing while you wait for help to arrive.
- Cover them with a blanket or coat to keep them warm.

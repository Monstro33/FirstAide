<h2>ASSESS THE SITUATION</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/AdultShock/adultShock9.jpg)

- Rescue breathing is used for people who are unconscious and breathing and have a pulse.

<h2>CHECK RESPONSIVENESS</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/ChildRescueBreathing/childRescueBreathing2.jpg)

- If the child is on their side or stomach, then gently roll him onto his back while trying to support their head and neck.
- Ask questions like, "What is your name?", "Are you alright?", and "Can you hear me?"
- Also tap their shoulder or arm while you do it to see if that will help as well.
- If this doesn't work, try yelling once or twice at them to see if that will rouse them. Yell phrases such as "Hey!" or "Hello!" to see if they wakes up.

<h2>CHECK FOR BREATHING AND CONSCIOUSNESS</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/ChildRescueBreathing/childRescueBreathing3.jpg)

- Check to see if the child is unconscious, but breathing, and has no other life-threatening conditions.
- Talk to the child to assess if they are responsive.
- Check for breathing by placing your cheek near the nose and mouth of the child to feel their breath.
- If the child is BREATHING ADEQUATELY and unconscious or semi-conscious, you can place them in the recovery position.
- If the child HAS A PULSE but is not breathing or not breathing adequately:

<h2>CHECK FOR PULSE</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/AdultShock/adultShock7.jpg)

- Press firmly but not so hard that you can no longer feel the pulse.
- Put your index and third finger on either side of the neck to the side of the windpipe to find the carotid artery.
- If you’re measuring on the wrist, set two fingers between the bone and tendon over your radial artery.
- Find the radial artery by drawing a line with your finger from below the thumb to the wrist. Then feel for the spot between the wrist bone and tendon for a slight pumping motion.
- Place the flat part of your finger on the wrist or neck to get the most accurate reading. Avoid using your fingertips or your thumb.
- If the child does not have a pulse:

<h2>POSITION THE HEAD</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/ChildRescueBreathing/childRescueBreathing3.jpg)

- The head should be straight and not tilted to either side.
- Put one hand under the child’s chin and the other on the top of the head. Gently tilt the head back and lift the chin.
- Use your thumb and forefinger to close the child’s nose. If the child is younger than one year, you don’t need to do this because you will breathe into both the child’s nose and mouth.
- Do not move the head more than necessary if you think the child may have a spinal cord injury.

<h2>PROVIDE RESCUE BREATHS</h2>

- Take a breath and lean over the child so that your lips are over their mouth and form an airtight seal.
- Breathe gently and steadily into the child’s mouth for one to one and a half seconds, watching for the chest to rise.
- After exhaling into the child’s mouth turn your head and watch to see if the chest deflates as it would during natural breathing.
- If so, this suggests that the breath was effective and the airway is not blocked.

<h2>CLEAR THE AIRWAY IF NECESSARY</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/ChildRescueBreathing/childRescueBreathing4.jpg)

- If the airway is obstructed, you may see that the breath you exhale doesn’t inflate the lungs.
- Open the child’s mouth. Look inside to see if you see any pieces of food or objects that the child may have choked on. If so, remove them.
- Do not poke your fingers or any other object deep into the child’s throat. If you do, you run the risk of pushing an object further in.
- If you don't see an object, reposition the child's head and try another rescue breath.

<h2>CALL 9-1-1</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/AdultCPR/adultCPR2.jpg)

- After performing 2 minutes of rescue breathing, call Emergency Services if you are the only person available.
- If two or more people are available, one person should dial for help while the other continues with rescue breathing.

<h2>CONTINUE RESCUE BREATHING</h2>

![Alt text](/Images/ChildRescueBreathing/childRescueBreathing6.jpg)

- Continue rescue breathing, giving one breath every 6 seconds (10 breaths per minute).
- Check for a pulse every two minutes while doing rescue breathing.
- Continue with rescue breathing until the child begins breathing on their own.
- You will notice that they are improving if they start coughing or moving.
- If the child loses consciousness and is not breathing or not breathing adequately:
